🚀 exe2shell 🚀
Welcome to exe2shell! This is a super-duper, ultra-mega, hyper-giga, turbo-tera byte reader that can read executable files in chunks and format their content into a string of hexadecimal values. It’s so cool, it’s practically sub-zero! ❄️

🐍 Python Version 🐍
Here’s how to use the Python version of exe2shell:

Save the Python code in a file named exe2shell.py.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing exe2shell.py.
Run the program with python3 exe2shell.py test_file.exe.
Replace exe2shell.py and test_file.exe with your actual file names. If you encounter any errors during execution, the error message should give you information about what went wrong. You can then modify your code accordingly and try again.

Example usage:

$ python3 exe2shell.py my_cool_file.exe
\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f\x2c\x20\x77\x6f\x72\x6c\x64\x21

🦀 Rust Version 🦀
Here’s how to use the Rust version of exe2shell:

Save the Rust code in a file named exe2shell.rs.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing exe2shell.rs.
Run the command rustc exe2shell.rs to compile the code. This will create an executable file named exe2shell in the same directory.
Run the program with ./exe2shell test_file.exe.
Replace exe2shell.rs, exe2shell, and test_file.exe with your actual file names. If you encounter any errors during compilation, the error message should give you information about what went wrong. You can then modify your code accordingly and try again.

Example usage:

$ rustc exe2shell.rs
$ ./exe2shell my_cool_file.exe
\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f\x2c\x20\x77\x6f\x72\x6c\x64\x21

That’s it! Now go forth and convert some executables! 🚀
